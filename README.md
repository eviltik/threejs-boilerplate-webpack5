# Threejs boilerplate webpack5 (dev)

Just learning and playing with [threejs](https://threejs.org), [webrx](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) 
and more, thinking at a high level virtual reality library. Probably like plenty of addicts having some dev skill ;)

I "only" have an Oculus Quest 2 for testing, feel free to give feedbacks with other devices. 


# Videoconference exploration

* [x] [Webcam texture](https://threejs.innovastorm.com/curved-rectangle/)
* [x] [Curved rectangle](https://threejs.innovastorm.com/curved-rectangle/)
* [ ] Webrtc implementation


# Usage

* Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/eviltik/threejs-boilerplate-webpack5
cd threejs-boilerplate-webpack5
npm install
npm run dev
```

We need webpack5 installed globally `npm install webpack5` atm.

Then, open your browser (https://localhost:44390/)
