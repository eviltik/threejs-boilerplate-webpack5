# Threejs boilerplate webpack5 (dev)

Just learning and playing with [threejs](https://threejs.org), [webrx](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) 
and more, thinking at a high level virtual reality library. Probably like plenty of addicts having some dev skill ;)

I "only" have an Oculus Quest 2 for testing, feel free to give feedbacks with other devices.
